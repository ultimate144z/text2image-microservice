Go to root of the folder:
e.g:
C:\Users\HP\Desktop\fresh_test\Untitled Folder 13

and then make sure three separate command prompts are opened.

Below are commands:

1. python -m grpc_service.server


2. uvicorn fastapi_bridge:app --reload
-> check http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs


3. python frontend_gradio.py

For Docker, first install it on your system and then go to root like before but this time run:

docker build -t text2image-microservice .
